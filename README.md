# Demography 7283
Statistics for Demographic Data 2
DEM 5283/7283
Spring 2021

## Course Information
Mondays 6-8:30
Instructor: Dr. Corey S. Sparks
Office hours:  Monday afternoons, preferably by appointment
corey.sparks@utsa.edu

## Course Description:
This course represents an in-depth coverage of the general linear model framework, including alternative logistic regression models, count-data regression and multi-level modeling. Model fit, model comparison and regression diagnostics for each method are covered. In addition to these topics, students are also introduced to techniques for variable reduction and analysis of data from complex surveys.  All methods will be illustrated with an appropriate demographic survey data set.
  

### Computer skills:
We will be using R. R is the language in which most research statisticians work and current methodological developments are being made, it is also free and can be used on any operating system. 

Please update your R version (4.0.3) to the latest release and update all your packages.

We will use R through Rstudio (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) and we will use Rpubs for turning in all assignments.

### RTools
You should also install the version 4.0 install of Rtools if you are a windows user.
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/
For those of you interested in R, I have published all of the examples from this class, and my other classes to my Rpubs site: http://rpubs.com/corey_sparks, so you can follow along with that stuff if you choose.

I will also post data and other resources to my Github repository https://github.com/coreysparks/DEM7093 

## R packages for the class
Copy and paste the following command in Rstudio to install the packages we will use in this class:

source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreysparks/Rcode/master/install_first_7283.R")

In Rstudio. Please have these programs downloaded and installed prior to class.
