In this example, we continue the discussion of the logistic regression model from [last week](https://rpubs.com/corey_sparks/575454). 

This week we examine model nesting and stratification. 

We also look at using the logistic regression model for a binary classification model, commonly used in machine learning.

## Analysis

First make our analytical dataset and our survey design information

```{r}
library(dplyr)
sub<-brfss_17%>%
  select(badhealth,mmsaname, bmi, agec,race_eth, marst, educ,white, black, hispanic, other, smoke, ins, mmsawt, ststr) 
#First we tell R our survey design
options(survey.lonely.psu = "adjust")
des<-svydesign(ids=~1, strata=~ststr, weights=~mmsawt, data =sub )
```


```{r}
#Logit model
fit.logit<-svyglm(badhealth~race_eth+educ+agec,
                  design= des,
                  family=binomial)

summary(fit.logit)
```

## Nested model comparison
Often in a research setting we are interested in comparing several models, and almost never are we satisfied with a single solitary model. This is because the literature on our subjects often has multiple facets to it. So, for instance, we may be interested in how SES mediates the effects of race/ethnicity on health (see [Shuey and Wilson 2008](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0164027507311151) and [Sudano and Baker 2005](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16055252) or [Hummer 1993](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2579860.pdf)  for a few examples of these types of analysis). 


$$y = \beta_0 + \text{Race\Eth}$$
$$y = \beta_0 + \text{Race\Eth} +\text{Gender} $$

$$y = \beta_0 + \text{Race\Eth} +\text{Gender} + \text{SES}$$
Typically in these types of analysis, predictor variables are entered into the model in "blocks". For example, let's look at the self-rated health outcome (0=good or excellent health, 1= fair/poor health) from [last week](http://rpubs.com/corey_sparks/245830). But instead of entering all variables in the model simultaneously, we begin with the effect of race/ethnicity, then add the effect of SES then the effects of health behavior variables.

```{r }
fit.logit1<-svyglm(badhealth~race_eth,design= des, family=binomial) #race only
fit.logit2<-svyglm(badhealth~race_eth+educ,design= des, family=binomial) #race+education
fit.logit3<-svyglm(badhealth~race_eth+educ+ins+smoke,design= des, family=binomial)#race+education+health behaviors

summary(fit.logit1)
```


In model 1 we see that Hispanics and blacks have a higher odds of reporting poor self rated health, compared to non-Hispanic whites, while the "other" group shows lower odds of reporting poor health.

Now, let's see if, by controlling for education, some of these differences go away, or are reduced. The fancy word for when an effect is reduced is *"attenuated"*. We will also do a test to see if the model with the education term significantly improves the model fit. Traditionally this would be done using a likelihood ratio test, but in survey models, that's not kosher

```{r}
summary(fit.logit2)
regTermTest(fit.logit2, test.terms = ~educ, method="Wald", df = NULL)
```

so, we see the race effects in all groups attenuate (reduce in size) somewhat after considering education, so the differences in health are smaller once you control for education.

The F test also suggest that the second model fits the data better than the first. It is another of these omnibus tests that asks whether there is any variation in our outcome by education in the second model.

Next we consider the third model, which contains health behaviors of current smoking and insurance coverage:

```{r}
summary(fit.logit3)
regTermTest(fit.logit3, test.terms=~ins+smoke, method="Wald", df = NULL)
```

In this model, we see the effects for Hispanics and blacks go back up. This is somewhat confusing, but is most likely related to the differential rates of smoking among those groups, compared to whites. Both current and former smokers are more likely to report poor/fair health, while insurance coverage does not affect the odds at all. Finally, we see that the model is significantly better fitting than the previous model. 


```{r, results='asis'}
myexp<-function(x){exp(x)}
stargazer(fit.logit1, fit.logit2, fit.logit3,type = "html", out ="~/OneDrive - University of Texas at San Antonio/classes/dem7283/class_21_7283/tab1.html",
            
          style="demography",
          covariate.labels =c("Black","MultRace" ,"Other","NHWhite", "PrimarySchool", "SomeHS","SomeColl", "CollGrad", "Insurance", "Current Smoker", "Former Smoker"),
          ci = T,
          apply.coef = myexp ,
          t.auto = F)

```

$$AIC = -2LL + 2*K$$


## Stratified models
Often in the literature, we will see models stratified by some predictor. This is usually because a specific hypothesis is stated regarding how the effect of a particular predictor varies by some categorical variable. In this case, we may be interested in considering if education or smoking universally affects the poor health outcome. We get at this by *stratifying* our analysis by race (in this example).

The easiest way to do this is to subset the data by race and run the models separately. 

**The first thing we do** is test for the interaction of education and race. If this interaction is not significant, we have no justification for proceeding, because the effect of education does not vary by race group. **This is the test of parallel slopes, a' la the ANCOVA model**

```{r}
fit.logitint<-svyglm(badhealth~race_eth*educ+ins+smoke,design= des, family=binomial)#race*education interaction+health behaviors
regTermTest(fit.logitint, test.terms = ~race_eth:educ, method = "Wald", df=NULL)
```

Here, the F-test does indicate that the interaction term in the model is significant, so the effects of education are not constant by race. 

Now we stratify our models:

```{r}
fit.unrestricted<-svyglm(badhealth~educ+ins+smoke,
                         design= des,
                         family=binomial)

fit.logit.white<-svyglm(badhealth~(educ+ins+smoke),
                        design= subset(des, white==1),
                        family=binomial)
  
fit.logit.black<-svyglm(badhealth~(educ+ins+smoke),
                        design= subset(des, black==1),
                        family=binomial)

fit.logit.other1<-svyglm(badhealth~(educ+ins+smoke),
                         design= subset(des, race_eth=="nh other"),
                         family=binomial)

fit.logit.other2<-svyglm(badhealth~(educ+ins+smoke),
                         design= subset(des, race_eth=="nh multirace"),
                         family=binomial)

fit.logit.hisp<-svyglm(badhealth~(educ+ins+smoke),
                       design= subset(des, hispanic==1),
                       family=binomial)

```

Here we examine the model results next to one another
```{r, results='asis'}
myexp<-function(x){exp(x)}

stargazer(fit.logit.white, fit.logit.black, fit.logit.hisp, fit.logit.other1, fit.logit.other2,
          type = "html",
          style="demography",
          covariate.labels =c(  "Primary","Some HS", "Some College", "College Grad", "Insurance", "Current Smoker", "Former Smoker","Intercept"),
          column.labels = c("NH White", "NH Black", "Hispanic", "NH Other 1", "NH Other 2"),
          ci=T ,
          apply.coef = myexp)

```


```{r}
beta.test<-function(model1, model2, betaname){
s1<-summary(model1)$coef
s2<-summary(model2)$coef
db <- ((s2[rownames(s2)==betaname,1]-s1[rownames(s1)==betaname,1]))^2
sd <-s2[rownames(s2)==betaname,2]^2+s1[rownames(s1)==betaname,2]^2
td <- db/sd
beta1=s1[rownames(s1)==betaname,1]
beta2=s2[rownames(s2)==betaname,1]
pv<-1- pchisq(td, df = 1)
print(list(beta=betaname,beta1=beta1, beta2=beta2, x2=td, pvalue=pv))
}

```

Here is an example of testing if the "Current Smoking" effect is the same among whites and blacks. This follows the logic set forth in [Allison 2010, p 219](https://books.google.com/books?id=RmbZ2y1KLwUC&q=219#v=snippet&q=219&f=false)

Test for $\beta_{1j} = \beta_{1k}$ in two models $j \text{ and } k$
$$z= \frac{\beta_{1j} - \beta_{1k}}{\left[ s.e.(\beta_{1j}) \right]^2+\left[ s.e.(\beta_{1k}) \right]^2}$$


```{r}
 beta.test(fit.logit.hisp, fit.logit.white, betaname = "educ4colgrad")
```
Which in this case, shows that the effect of college education is not significantly different between Hispanic and Non Hispanic white respondents. 


## Logistic Regression as a Predictive Model

## Classification methods and models

In classification methods, we are typically interested in using some observed characteristics of a case to predict a binary categorical outcome. This can be extended to a multi-category outcome, but the largest number of applications involve a 1/0 outcome.

Below, we look at using Logistic regression

There are other methods for doing this that we will not examine but these are probably the easiest to understand.

In these examples, we will use the Demographic and Health Survey [Model Data](https://dhsprogram.com/data/Model-Datasets.cfm). These are based on the DHS survey, but are publicly available and are used to practice using the DHS data sets, but don't represent a real country.

In this example, we will use the outcome of contraceptive choice (modern vs other/none) as our outcome.


```{r, warning=TRUE}
library(haven)
dat<-url("https://github.com/coreysparks/data/blob/master/ZZIR62FL.DTA?raw=true")
model.dat<-read_dta(dat)
model.dat<-zap_labels(model.dat)

```

Here we recode some of our variables and limit our data to those women who are not currently pregnant and who are sexually active.

```{r}
library(dplyr)

model.dat2<-model.dat%>%
  mutate(region = v024, 
         modcontra= as.factor(ifelse(v364 ==1,1, 0)),
         age = v012, 
         livchildren=v218,
         educ = v106,
         currpreg=v213,
         knowmodern=ifelse(v301==3, 1, 0),
         age2=v012^2)%>%
  filter(currpreg==0, v536>0)%>% #notpreg, sex active
  dplyr::select(caseid, region, modcontra,age, age2,livchildren, educ, knowmodern)

```

```{r, results='asis'}

knitr::kable(head(model.dat2))

```

### using caret to create training and test sets.
In predictive models, we split the data into two sets, a training set and a test set. The training set will be used to estimate the model parameters, and the test set will be used to validate the model's predictive ability. 

We use an 80% training fraction, which is standard. 

```{r}
library(caret)
set.seed(1115)
train<- createDataPartition(y = model.dat2$modcontra,
                            p = .80,
                            list=F)

model.dat2train<-model.dat2[train,]
model.dat2test<-model.dat2[-train,]

table(model.dat2train$modcontra)
prop.table(table(model.dat2train$modcontra))
```
```{r}
summary(model.dat2train)
```

## Logistic regression for classification
Here we use a basic binomial GLM to estimate the probability of a woman using modern contraception. We use information on their region of residence, age, number of living children and level of education. 

This model can be written: 
$$ln \left ( \frac{Pr(\text{Modern Contraception})}{1-Pr(\text{Modern Contraception})} \right ) = X' \beta$$

Which can be converted to the probability scale via the inverse logit transform:

$$Pr(\text{Modern Contraception}) = \frac{1}{1+exp (-X' \beta)}$$ 


```{r}
glm1<-glm(modcontra~factor(region)+scale(age)+scale(age2)+scale(livchildren)+factor(educ),
          data=model.dat2train[,-1],
          family = binomial)
summary(glm1)


```

We see that all the predictors are significantly related to our outcome

Next we see how the model performs in terms of accuracy of prediction. This is new comparison to how we typically use logistic regression. 

We use the `predict()` function to get the estimated class probabilities for each case

```{r}
tr_pred<- predict(glm1,
                  newdata = model.dat2train,
                  type = "response")

head(tr_pred)

```

These are the estimated probability that each of these women used modern contraception, based on the model. 

In order to create classes (uses modern vs doesn't use modern contraception) we have to use a **decision rule**. A decision rule is when we choose a cut off point, or *threshold* value of the probability to classify each observation as belonging to one class or the other.

A basic decision rule is if $Pr(y=\text{Modern Contraception} |X) >.5$ Then classify the observation as a modern contraception user, and otherwise not. This is what we will use here. 


```{r}

tr_predcl<-factor(ifelse(tr_pred>.5, 1, 0))

library(ggplot2)

pred1<-data.frame(pr=tr_pred, gr=tr_predcl, modcon=model.dat2train$modcontra)

pred1%>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(aes(x=pr, color=gr, fill=gr))+
  ggtitle(label = "Probability of Modern Contraception", subtitle = "Threshold = .5")+
  geom_vline(xintercept=.5)


pred1%>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(aes(x=pr, color=modcon, fill=modcon))+
  ggtitle(label = "Probability of Modern Contraception", subtitle = "Truth")+
  geom_vline(xintercept=.5)

```


Next we need to see how we did. A simple cross tab of the observed classes versus the predicted classes is called the **confusion matrix**. 

```{r}
table( tr_predcl,model.dat2train$modcontra)
```

This is great, but typically it's easier to understand the model's predictive ability by converting these to proportions. The `confusionMatrix()` function in `caret` can do this, plus other stuff. 

This provides lots of output summarizing the classification results. At its core is the matrix of observed classes versus predicted classes. I got one depiction of this [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/confusion-matrix-machine-learning/) and from the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix)

![Confusion matrix](C:/Users/ozd504/OneDrive - University of Texas at San Antonio/predictive_workinggroup/images/cm1.PNG)

Lots of information on the predictive accuracy can be found from this 2x2 table:


![Confusion matrix](C:/Users/ozd504/OneDrive - University of Texas at San Antonio/predictive_workinggroup/images/cm2.PNG)

Generally, we are interested in overall accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. 



```{r}
cm1<-confusionMatrix(data = tr_predcl,
                     reference = model.dat2train$modcontra )
cm1
```

Overall the model has a `r round(100*cm1$overall[1], 3)`% accuracy, which isn't bad! What is bad is some of the other measures. The sensitivity `r round(100*cm1$byClass[1])`%, and the Specificity is `r round(100*cm1$byClass[2])` In other word the model is pretty good at predicting if you don't use modern contraception, but not at predicting if you do. 

We could try a different decision rule, in this case, I use the mean of the response as the cutoff value. 

```{r}
tr_predcl<-factor(ifelse(tr_pred>mean(I(model.dat2train$modcontra==1)), 1, 0)) #mean of response

pred2<-data.frame(pr=tr_pred, gr=tr_predcl, modcon=model.dat2train$modcontra)

pred2%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=pr, fill=gr))+
  geom_histogram(position="identity", alpha=.2)+
  ggtitle(label = "Probability of Modern Contraception", subtitle = "Threshold = Mean")+
  geom_vline(xintercept=mean(I(model.dat2train$modcontra==1)))


pred2%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=pr, fill=modcon))+
  geom_histogram(position="identity", alpha=.2)+
  ggtitle(label = "Probability of Modern Contraception", subtitle = "Truth")+
  geom_vline(xintercept=mean(I(model.dat2train$modcontra==1)))



```


```{r}
confusionMatrix(data = tr_predcl,
                model.dat2train$modcontra,
                positive = "1" )

```

Which produces the same accuracy, but decreases the sensitivity at the cost of increased specificity.

Next we do this on the test set to evaluate model performance outside of the training data

```{r}
pred_test<-predict(glm1,
                   newdata=model.dat2test,
                   type="response")

pred_cl<-factor(ifelse(pred_test > mean( I(model.dat2test$modcontra==1)), 1, 0))

table(model.dat2test$modcontra,pred_cl)

confusionMatrix(data = pred_cl,model.dat2test$modcontra )

```

In the test data, the model does about as well as it did on the training data, which is ideal.
